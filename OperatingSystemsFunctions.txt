One of the main functions that the operating system does is managing the main memory of the device. Several bytes make up the main memory and each byte will have an address. This is accessed through the CPU and the program is loaded in the main memory for the program to run efficiently. The OS then tracks the main memory usage by each of the applications and the OS decides which memory should be allocated to which program and how much should be allocated.
Another operating system function is that it organizes the file system into directories so that files can be easily searched and used when it is needed. Each directory has other directories and other files. The information regarding the files, user access details and settings and the status of each files is monitored and organized through the operating system. Which helps the user to check the files and provide details of the files by checking the logs.
The operating system checks whether the system is able to work or is ready to work. If the system is not, the system reboots and the OS makes the system work, by shutting down all applications so that the application that uses the most storage is closed. The booting also helps to install and start newly installed software and to work based on the users needs.
